# Task: Simple Blog listing

Welcome to my React + Vite app! Below are instructions on how to run it locally.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/samibuzgau/job-post.git
   cd job-post
2. **Install the dependencies**
   npm install
   If this command does not work, you may not have installed Node.
   For installing Node, please follow the link https://nodejs.org/en
   and click on the button to download the LTS (Long Term Support) version.
3. **Run the application**
   You can now run the application by opening the terminal (if it is not already opened) by typing:
   npm run dev

Thank you!
